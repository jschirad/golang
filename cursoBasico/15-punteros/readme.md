This program demonstrates how to use pointers and methods in Go.

The program starts by defining a new struct type called pc that has three fields: ram, an int; disk, an int; and brand, a string.

Next, the program defines two methods on the pc struct: ping and duplicateRAM. The ping method takes a pc value as receiver and prints a message using the brand field of the receiver. The duplicateRAM method takes a pointer to a pc value as receiver and multiplies the ram field of the receiver by 2.

In the main function, the program starts by declaring an int variable called a and assigning it the value 50. Then it declares a pointer called b that points to a. The program prints the values of a and b, then dereferences b and prints the value it points to. Finally, it modifies the value pointed to by b and prints the new value of a.

Next, the program creates a new pc value and assigns it to the variable myPc. It then calls the ping and duplicateRAM methods on myPc and prints the value of myPc after calling each method.
