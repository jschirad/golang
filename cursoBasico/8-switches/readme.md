This code is written in the Go programming language and it shows how to use the switch statement in Go.

The switch statement in Go is used to execute a block of code based on the value of a variable or expression. It is similar to the if statement, but it can be used to match multiple values for the same variable or expression.

In the first example, the switch statement is used to check whether the value of the modulo variable is 0 or not. If the value of modulo is 0, the code in the first case block will be executed and it will print "Es par" (which means "It is even" in Spanish). If the value of modulo is not 0, the code in the default case will be executed and it will print "Es impar" (which means "It is odd" in Spanish).

In the second example, the switch statement is used to check whether the value of the value variable is greater than 100, less than 0, or neither. If the value of value is greater than 100, the code in the first case block will be executed and it will print "Mayor a 100" (which means "Greater than 100" in Spanish). If the value of value is less than 0, the code in the second case block will be executed and it will print "Menor a 0" (which means "Less than 0" in Spanish). If the value of value is neither greater than 100 nor less than 0, the code in the default case will be executed and it will print "No condition".

The switch statement in Go can also be used without a condition, in which case it will match the first case block whose expression evaluates to true. This can be useful for combining multiple conditions in a single switch statement.
