This program demonstrates how to use a package in Go. It uses a package called mypackage that defines a struct type called CarPublic and two functions: PrintMessage, which is public, and printMessage1, which is private.

To use the mypackage package, the program imports it with the alias pk using a import statement. Then it uses the pk.CarPublic and pk.PrintMessage to create a new CarPublic value and call the PrintMessage function.

The printMessage1 function is private, so it cannot be called directly from outside the package. Attempting to call it will result in a compile-time error.
