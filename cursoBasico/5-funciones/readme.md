This program demonstrates how to define and call functions in Go. A function is a block of code that can be called from other parts of a program to perform a specific task.

The program defines several functions, each of which demonstrates a different aspect of function declaration and calling in Go.

The normalFunction function is a simple function that takes a single argument of type string and prints this argument to the standard output using the fmt.Println function. This function does not return any values.

The tripeArgument function is similar to the normalFunction function, but it takes three arguments instead of one. The function declares the types of each argument in the function signature, which is the part of the function declaration that specifies the name, argument types, and return type of the function. In this case, the function takes three arguments: an int, another int, and a string. The function then prints these arguments to the standard output using the fmt.Println function.

The returnValue function is a simple function that takes an int argument and returns a value of type int. The function calculates the double of the input argument and returns this value.

The doubleReturn function is similar to the returnValue function, but it returns two values instead of one. The function takes an int argument and returns two values of type int, which are the input value and the double of the input value. The function uses the named return values syntax, which allows you to specify the names of the returned values in the function signature. In this case, the function declares two named return values called c and d, which are assigned the values returned by the function.

The main function calls each of these functions to demonstrate how to call a function and use its return values. The main function first calls the normalFunction function to print a message to the standard output. Then, it calls the tripeArgument function to print the values of three arguments.

Next, the main function calls the returnValue function and assigns the returned value to the value variable. The main function then prints the value of this variable using the fmt.Println function.

The main function then calls the doubleReturn function and assigns the returned values to the value1 and value2 variables. The main function then prints the values of these variables using the fmt.Printf function.

The main function then calls the doubleReturn function again and demonstrates how to use the blank identifier (_) to ignore one or more returned values.
