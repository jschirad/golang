This is a simple Go program that uses the fmt package to print the message "Hello world!" to the standard output. The fmt.Println function is used to print a line of output to the console, which in this case is the string "Hello world!".

The first line of the program, package main, indicates that this is the main package, which is the entry point of the program. The import statement is used to import the fmt package, which provides functions for formatting and printing output.

In Go, the main function is the entry point of the program, so the code inside this function will be executed when the program is run. In this case, the main function simply calls the fmt.Println function to print the "Hello world!" message.

Overall, this program is a simple example of how to print output in Go using the fmt package. It is a common way to learn a new programming language, as it allows you to quickly see the results of your code and verify that it is working as expected.
