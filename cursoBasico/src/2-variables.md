This program declares and uses several variables of different types in Go. The program starts by declaring two const variables: pi and pi2. const variables are used to declare constants in Go, which are values that cannot be changed once they are assigned. The pi variable is declared with the type float64, which is a floating-point number with double precision, while pi2 is declared without a type, in which case the type is inferred from the value assigned to it (in this case, float64 as well).

The program then prints the values of pi and pi2 using the fmt.Println function.

Next, the program declares and assigns values to several int variables. int is a type that represents an integer, which is a whole number without a fractional part. The base variable is declared and assigned a value using the := syntax, which is a shorthand for declaring and initializing a variable in Go. The altura variable is declared using the var keyword and explicitly specifies the type int, and the area variable is declared with the var keyword but without an initial value, which sets its value to the zero value for its type (in this case, 0).

The program then prints the values of the area, altura, and base variables using the fmt.Println function.

The program then declares four more variables using the var keyword: a, b, c, and d. These variables are declared without an initial value, so they are set to the zero value for their respective types: 0 for a (int), 0.0 for b (float64), an empty string for c (string), and false for d (bool). The program then prints the values of these variables using the fmt.Println function.

Finally, the program declares a constant called baseCuadrado and uses it to calculate the area of a square. The areaCuadrado variable is declared using the := syntax and is assigned the value of baseCuadrado squared (i.e., baseCuadrado * baseCuadrado). The program then prints the value of areaCuadrado using the fmt.Println function.

Overall, this program demonstrates how to declare and use variables of different types in Go, as well as how to use the const keyword to declare constants and the := syntax to declare and initialize variables.
