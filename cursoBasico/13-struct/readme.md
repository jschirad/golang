This program demonstrates how to define and use structs in Go.

The program starts by defining a new struct type called car that has two fields: brand, a string, and year, an int.

In the main function, the program creates a new car value using a struct literal and assigns it to the variable myCar. It then prints the value of myCar.

Next, the program creates a new car value using the zero value for the car type and assigns it to the variable mySecondCar. It then sets the brand field of mySecondCar to "Ferrari" and prints the value of mySecondCar.
