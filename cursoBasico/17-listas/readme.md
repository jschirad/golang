This program demonstrates how to use interfaces in Go. It defines an interface called figuras2D that has a single method called area. It also defines two struct types, cuadrado and rectangulo, that both have an area method that implements the area method from the figuras2D interface.

The cuadrado struct has a single field called base, which represents the length of one side of the square. The rectangulo struct has two fields: base, which represents the length of one side of the rectangle, and altura, which represents the height of the rectangle.

The calcular function takes a value of type figuras2D as input and prints the result of calling the area method on that value. Since both cuadrado and rectangulo types implement the area method from the figuras2D interface, they can be passed as arguments to the calcular function.

In the main function, the program creates a cuadrado value and a rectangulo value and assigns them to the variables myCuadrado and myRectangulo respectively. It then prints the values of myCuadrado and myRectangulo using the fmt.Println function. Since the cuadrado and rectangulo types have String methods, the output of fmt.Println will be the result of calling the String method on the values. This will print a custom string for each value.

Next, the program calls the calcular function with the values of myCuadrado and myRectangulo as arguments. This will print the areas of the square and rectangle by calling the area method on each value.

Finally, the program declares a slice of interface{} values called myInterface and initializes it with three values of different types: a string, an int, and a bool. It then prints the values in myInterface using the fmt.Println function with the ... syntax to expand the slice into individual arguments. This will print the three values in myInterface.
