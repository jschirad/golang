This program demonstrates how to perform basic arithmetic operations in Go, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The program starts by declaring a constant called baseCuadrado and using it to calculate the area of a square. The areaCuadrado variable is declared using the := syntax and is assigned the value of baseCuadrado squared (i.e., baseCuadrado * baseCuadrado). The program then prints the value of areaCuadrado using the fmt.Println function.

Next, the program declares two int variables called x and y and assigns them initial values of 10 and 50, respectively.

The program then performs several arithmetic operations using these variables, and prints the results using the fmt.Println function. The operations include addition (x + y), subtraction (y - x), multiplication (x * y), division (y / x), and modulo (y % x), which returns the remainder of a division operation.

The program also demonstrates how to use the ++ and -- operators to increment and decrement the value of a variable, respectively. The x++ operator increments the value of x by 1, and the x-- operator decrements it by 1.

Overall, this program shows how to perform basic arithmetic operations in Go using built-in operators, as well as how to use the fmt.Println function to print the results of these operations.
