This code is written in the Go programming language and it shows how to use the defer, continue, and break statements in Go.

The defer statement in Go is used to delay the execution of a function or statement until the surrounding function returns. This can be useful for performing cleanup tasks or other tasks that need to be done after the main function has finished.

In this code, the defer statement is used to print "Adios!" (which means "Goodbye" in Spanish) after the main function has finished executing. This means that "Adios!" will be printed after "Hola Mundo!" (which means "Hello World" in Spanish).

The continue statement in Go is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and continue with the next iteration. This can be useful for skipping over certain values in a loop or for implementing complex looping conditions.

In this code, the continue statement is used inside the for loop to skip the rest of the loop body when the value of i is 2. This means that when i is 2, the code will print "Es 2" (which means "It is 2" in Spanish) and then continue with the next iteration of the loop.

The break statement in Go is used to exit the innermost enclosing for, switch, or select statement. This can be useful for stopping a loop or for exiting a switch or select statement early.

In this code, the break statement is used inside the for loop to exit the loop when the value of i is 8. This means that when i is 8, the code will print "Break" and then exit the loop.
