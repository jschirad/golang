This code is written in the Go programming language and it shows how to use the if statement in Go, as well as how to convert strings to numbers using the strconv package.

The if statement in Go is used to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is met. The code in the else block is executed if the condition is not met.

The code uses the strconv package to convert strings to numbers using the Atoi() function. This function takes a string as input and returns an integer and an error. If the conversion is successful, the error will be nil and the integer value can be used. If the conversion is not successful, the error will contain information about why the conversion failed.

In this code, the if statements are used to compare the values of valor1 and valor2 and print out whether the condition is true or false. The && and || operators are used to combine multiple conditions in the if statement.

The code also shows how to use the Atoi() function to convert strings to numbers. In the first example, the string "53" is successfully converted to the integer 53. In the second example, the string "hola" cannot be converted to a number, so the Atoi() function returns an error.
