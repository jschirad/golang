This program demonstrates how to use the fmt package to print messages and format output in Go.

The program starts by declaring two variables called helloMessage and worldMessage and assigns them string values of "Hello" and "world!", respectively.

The program then uses the fmt.Println function to print the values of these variables, separated by a space. This function automatically adds a newline character at the end of the output, so the output will be displayed on two separate lines.

Next, the program declares two more variables called nombre and cursos and assigns them the values "Platzi" and 500, respectively. The nombre variable is a string, while cursos is an int (integer) type.

The program then uses the fmt.Printf function to print the values of these variables, along with some text. The %s and %d placeholder characters in the format string are used to insert the values of nombre and cursos into the output, respectively. The %s placeholder is used for string values, and the %d placeholder is used for decimal values (i.e., integers).

The fmt.Printf function also allows you to use the %v placeholder, which is a "value" placeholder that can be used for any type of value. In this case, the %v placeholder is used to print the values of nombre and cursos, without specifying the types of these values.

The program then uses the fmt.Sprintf function to create a string containing the formatted output of the previous fmt.Printf call. The fmt.Sprintf function is similar to fmt.Printf, but instead of printing the output to the standard output, it returns the output as a string value. This string value is assigned to the message variable, and the program then uses the fmt.Println function to print the value of message.

Finally, the program uses the fmt.Printf function to print the types of the helloMessage and cursos variables. The %T placeholder is used to insert the type of the value, so the output will be something like "helloMessage string" and "Cursos int".

Overall, this program shows how to use the fmt package to print and format output in Go, as well as how to use the fmt.Sprintf function to create a string containing formatted output.
